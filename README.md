### Welcome to my GitHub page
Here I am sharing code/scripts as well as plots and tables that were used in publications where I am a co-author. 
Scripts are give as they were running on my local machine, unless indicated otherwise. The scope of this repository is to provide documentation as well as the ugly plots and tables used to provide shiny figures. 
In some cases I also share additional information that did not make it into the publication or explanations that help, in my opinion, the understanding of the data.
Code is organised into figures as in the final publication.
